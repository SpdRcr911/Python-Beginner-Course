# Python Beginner Course

## Welcome

First of all you need to know that I am not a professional teacher. Second of all, I am a software engineer and my background is VSTS and dotnet. So I'm teaching as I learn.

I have six kids and this repo in intended to teach my kids Python and working with GitHub. 

You're welcome to fork it and use it for your own purposes. If you come up with any cool changes or udpates, please make a pull request and I will take a look.
